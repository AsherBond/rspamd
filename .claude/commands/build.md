description: Build and install Rspamd using ninja
---

Build and install Rspamd:

1. Navigate to build directory: `~/rspamd.build`
2. Run: `ninja -j8 install`
3. Report build status and any errors
4. If build succeeds, suggest running tests

This uses the project's out-of-source build system with Ninja.
